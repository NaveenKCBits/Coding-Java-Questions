# Coding-Java-Questions
This repo will have some of the famous Java programming question's answer (as form of code)

## About JAVA Language 
JAVA was developed by Sun Microsystems Inc in the year 1991, later acquired by Oracle Corporation.
It was developedby James Gosling and Patrik Naughton.

JAVA is a class-based, object-oriented programming language and is designed to have as few implementation 
dependencies as possible. Java applications are compiled to byte code that can run on any java virtual machine.

## Basic Terminologies of Java

`1.` Java Development Kit (JDK) : It is a complete java development kit that includes everthing including compiler, Java run time environment (JRE), debuggers, Samples, Documentation etc.
`2.` Java Virtual Machine (JVM) :  JVM executes the bytecode generated by the Java compiler.
`3.` Bytecode by Compiler : Javac compiler of JDK compiles the java source code into bytecode so that it can be executed by JVM. It is saved as .class file by the compiler.
`4.` Java Runtime Environment (JRE) : JAVA Development kit includes JRE, to run the java programs after compilation JRE is needed.
`5.` Garbage Collector : For memory management JVM has a program that take care to recollect the memory that are not referenced. This program is known as Garbage collector.
`6.` ClassPath : This is a file path where java runtime and java compiler search for .class files and external libraries to load.
